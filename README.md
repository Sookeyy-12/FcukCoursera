# FcukCoursera
My university assigned Coursera courses with tight deadlines, and I kept remembering them at the last minute. So I built this tool to automate the entire process and finish everything in under 5 minutes.

## Features
- **Skip Videos**: Automatically marks all course videos as watched.
- **Skip Readings**: Automatically marks all reading materials as completed.
- **Solve Quizzes (Beta)**: Uses Google's Gemini AI to answer quiz questions.
- **Complete Course**: Runs all the above actions in sequence to finish the course.

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable **Developer mode** in the top right corner.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `CourseraSkipper` folder from this repository.

## Usage
1. **Get a Gemini API Key**:
   - Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
   - Create a new API key.
2. **Open Coursera**:
   - Log in to Coursera and navigate to the home page of the course you want to complete.
3. **Run the Extension**:
   - Click the **FcukCoursera** icon in your browser toolbar.

   - Click **Complete Course** to do everything at once, or use individual buttons for specific tasks.
